# todo-list-flask
To further understand my knowledge of Flask and SQL, I created a to-do list utilizing the library Flask and SQLAlchemy database. 

In this mini-project, I created a web application with Flask using Python. Creating objects for each task the user creates in Python, using methods GET and POST, updates the database in SQLAlchemy corresponding to what the user enters/edits.
